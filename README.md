## Introduction
With the growing number of students and the diverse range of questions they have, it is essential to have an immediate, efficient, and effective system in place to answer their queries. The University-Wide FAQ Chatbot aims to bridge this gap and provide instant solutions to students.

## Problem Statement
Students often have to navigate multiple platforms, websites, and departments to find answers to their questions. This process can be time-consuming, and sometimes, they may not get the desired information.

## Project Motivation
To streamline the query-resolution process, reduce redundancy in seeking information, and enhance the student experience by offering instant, relevant answers.

## Project Overview
The Chatbot will:
- Integrate with existing university systems.
- Continuously learn from past student interactions.
- Provide direct links to resources.
- Incorporate a feedback mechanism for continuous improvement.

## Platform Details

- **Coding Platform:** Local or cloud-based environment for Python and JavaScript development.
- **Cloud Platform:** AWS/Azure/GCP (based on university preference and cost considerations).
- **Prerequisites:**
  - Python 3.x
  - Node.js (for frontend)
  - MySQL
  - Docker
- **Services:**
  - NLP Service for chatbot intelligence.
  - Web Hosting for the chatbot interface.
  - API Gateway for university website and social media integration.
- **Database:** MySQL for storing student queries, feedback, and chatbot responses.
- **Container:** Docker for deployment and scaling.
- **Storage:** Secure, encrypted storage in MySQL for chat logs and feedback.
- **Languages:**
  - **Backend:** Python
  - **Frontend:** JavaScript (using a modern JS framework like React or Vue.js)

## Development & Interaction Workflow

1. Students initiate interactions via the chatbot on the university's website.
2. The NLP service processes their query.
3. The chatbot either fetches a relevant answer from the database or directs students to appropriate resources or departments.
4. After receiving an answer, students can provide feedback for further enhancement of the system.

## Timelines and Milestones
